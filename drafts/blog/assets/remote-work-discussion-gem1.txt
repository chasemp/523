So I work in the tech industry, uh primarily kind of uh systems administration, security, sub development.

That's a really diverse background! Systems administration, security, and software development cover a lot of ground. What are you interested in exploring further?

and I have been working on Hold on. Hold on. I've been working on fully remote, globally distributed teams for almost the last 15 years. And I really love remote. I know it's not for everyone. But I would like to write like a not a super long, but just a most important kind of 15 years on reflection blog post, but it doesn't necessarily have to be so long. Maybe it can just be, you know, a couple of highlights. And I'm hoping that you can kind of interview me and we can talk about it and then use that to sort of write the blog post.

That sounds like a fantastic idea and 15 years is a significant milestone! I'd be happy to interview you. Where should we start? Perhaps with the biggest challenges you've faced in remote work, or the most rewarding aspects?

I mean, challenges, let's see. What's challenging about being remote?

One common challenge is maintaining strong team connections and effective communication across different time zones. Also, achieving the right work-life balance can be tricky. Have these been significant for you?

uh if you are in a mixed environment where you are sort of the minority remote, I would say that to be just uh work from home. I guess to me, I separate work from home as like sometimes I work from home, you know, remote to me means things are organized for folks to kind of all be remote. So one of the difficulties is kind of mixed where there is a significant uh presence of people in one specific case where you still working kind of you know, in the past you in the hallway, oh hey, yeah. And so the cultural norms that may really guide remote work function well are difficult to attract and

That's a really insightful distinction between "work from home" and truly remote work. It makes sense that in a mixed environment, the established culture can create friction for remote team members, almost like being an outsider. What specific cultural norms have you found most challenging?

My brother talk more about what's good or what I'd like rather than focus on kind of what's hard, some of that, but really it's uh I've enjoyed it.

I understand! Let's focus on the positives and the aspects you've really enjoyed over the past 15 years. What are some of the biggest rewards you've experienced in remote work?

Wow.

It seems you're cutting out again. Did you want to share some of the rewards you've enjoyed?

So, it's not a coincidence that my oldest is almost 15 because prior to her being born, you know, I was going into an office with about 30 to 45 commute there way and it was, you know, a long hour job. So, I would get up and leave at 5:30 or 6:00 and pretty often wouldn't be home till

It sounds like the flexibility and time with your family were major drivers and significant rewards of remote work for you. That shift from a long commute to being home for your daughter must have made a huge difference. What does that improved flexibility mean to you?

sixer later and I just for me I realized that I didn't feel like I would get to spend as much time as I wanted. And so even though we have had a really um kind of well-defined when I'm home but working I'm at work. We have this I have a separate office. And you know even when the kids were little like they knew that if the office door was closed that they couldn't come in or knock or ask me questions like unless something's an emergency. So

That structured routine and dedicated space sound key to making remote work successful for you, especially with family. It allowed you to prioritize personal time without sacrificing professionalism. Are there any specific practices you'd recommend to others seeking that balance?

It's called like birds of a feather or hold on, hold on. I was in like an open spaces thing at a conference for uh open stack, now the open infrastructure foundation. And you know, the whole thing was just people who work for them would talking about it. And there was a gentleman from Red Hat. And Red Hat's been doing you know, really like uh well-defined remote work for a long time within the industry. Uh and there was a gentleman who stood up and was talking about why remote work has been impactful to him.

That's a really interesting anecdote and highlights the value of those discussions. It seems like for many, remote work provides the opportunity to align personal and professional goals more effectively. What would you say was the most significant positive shift in your life because of remote work?

All done. Not done. Uh, he said that he had experienced, you know, a uh difficulty in being promoted and sometimes his ability, but that he had been able to walk his daughter to school every single day from um kindergarten through high school. And not that you can't necessarily, you don't work from home, but uh it certainly gives you options. So I think my point there is just for me at least and for my family, remote has been a lifestyle, you know.

That is a truly powerful sentiment. It sounds like remote work has provided you with the ability to prioritize personal and family life in a way that traditional work couldn't. That kind of impact is definitely worth highlighting in your reflections. Are there specific moments or examples that come to mind when you think about that?

I treat remote work just like work. I don't do other things when I'm working.

That perspective is really impactful, that remote work has enabled a certain lifestyle centered around family, while still maintaining professional boundaries. It sounds like that ability to prioritize family without sacrificing career is a core benefit for you.

Agreed.

So, when you think about the blog post, are there any particular aspects of the lifestyle you'd like to highlight? Perhaps the structure you created for work and family, or the freedom it provided?

Now, I think I just want to highlight that that point was very impactful for me. This is more like a shared personal reflection than like a deep dive or instruction manual or something like that.

That focus on the personal impact is perfect for a reflective piece. So, it's more about the journey and the profound changes it brought to your life and family rather than specific professional advice. Is that right?

Um, one of the things that I want to uh acknowledge I guess is, you know,

Understood. A personal reflection focused on the lifestyle impact. Is there anything else you'd like to make sure to acknowledge in this piece?

I've been working remote since kind of before there was a big boost during the pandemic or you know increase in the number of people and some folks worked you know quote unquote from home and remote only during the pandemic. I wanted to say that that was a very atypical thing like every lots of things were hard and you were often kind of isolated in your house and it wasn't planned for and like you know it was a thing that was thrust upon people they didn't build up to and a lot of folks

That's a really crucial point to differentiate. Your experience is a result of a conscious choice and built-up structure, which is very different from the sudden, unplanned transition many faced during the pandemic. We can definitely highlight that distinction. Is there anything else you feel is important to include?

actions that are different. Please hold on. Hold on. She missed the routine. She missed really just being around people. Like it it is a lifestyle and part of that is you know, you have to have social outlets outside of work and also, you know, at least for me and what I do, you have to be good with kind of heads down, lots of solo time and and you know, task execution and like you don't have to be a loner, but you certainly have to be able to sort of thrive in the context. But the other side to that that's interesting to me is you know, I've heard or read people push back on you know, remote's not as effective. People can't be as effective effective on remote.

You're highlighting key aspects of the remote lifestyle that are different from the pandemic experience, like the need for social outlets and suitability for focused, solo work. It's interesting to consider the perception versus the reality based on long-term experience. Are there specific examples you'd like to include that illustrate that distinction?

That speaks to me of Please hold on. That speaks to me of like it isn't necessarily a particular problem set, maybe the way we approach it. Like there's a confluence of factors. But the other thing that kind of aligns with that is some of the aspersions cast on remote seem to skip over like we've been doing remote immersions of it collectively for a very long time. I've worked for a number of kind of mid-sized enough companies and we almost always had offices in other places. You were remote from people who you had to collaborate with pretty often.

That's a very experienced perspective. The idea that "remote immersion" has been ongoing for a long time due to distributed teams is definitely compelling when considering common criticisms. So, your reflection could tie together the personal and professional evolution of remote work, grounded in your 15-year journey. How does that sound?

business. It's all in one building in one physical location.

That's a valid perspective that even within traditional companies, distributed teams have always existed, requiring remote collaboration. So, your reflection can discuss the evolution of these "remote immersions" and how they've paved the way for the current landscape, emphasizing the importance of deliberate cultural and structural choices. Does that capture what you mean?

Yeah, I think so.

Great! So, we have a good starting point for your reflection, covering the personal impact of remote work and distinguishing it from pandemic-driven situations. Is there any particular tone you're aiming for, like very professional or more conversational?

conversational, casual, personal, but from a, you know, in a professional capacity.

Perfect. Conversational, casual, and professionally personal. I have a clear picture now to help you craft that blog post. Are you ready to dive into some specific reflections?

No, I want to talk more about just remote in general, I think. But I'm trying to figure out kind of what else I have to say about it that I want to incorporate.

In a conversational style, you could touch on things like the evolution of remote work over the years, beyond the pandemic, or the specific personal disciplines you developed to thrive in this environment, like your dedicated office setup. Does either of those resonate for inclusion?

Now, I feel like the evolution thing is not very personal. Like that's just kind of industry-wide. And I'm looking for more of like a this is not a condemnation of people who don't like remote. This is my kind of personal experience, field report, like putting out there my experience, uh, you know, just so that it's shared, especially since I've done it for a while. Um, I think maybe what we have is okay. I'm and I want to kind of think on what else I would want to include, but a draft might be useful to do that.

That makes sense. A draft can be a great way to see what we have and what might be missing. Based on your personal experience focus, I can draft an introduction and some key points around the lifestyle transformation and the distinction from pandemic remote work. How does that sound?

Yep. Good.

Great, I'll get started on that draft for you. We can refine it together once you see it.

Draft pls

It sounds like you’ve navigated the "long game" of remote work, moving far beyond the temporary shift many experienced in 2020. This draft captures that transition from the grueling commute to a deliberate lifestyle choice centered around family and focused execution.

A 15-Year Field Report: Why Remote Work is a Lifestyle, Not Just a Location
It isn’t a coincidence that my oldest daughter is about to turn 15.

Before she was born, my life was defined by the "5:30 AM shuffle." I’d be out the door before the sun was up, facing a 45-minute commute each way, and I often wouldn’t walk back through my front door until 6:00 PM or later. I looked at that trajectory and realized I wasn't going to get the time I wanted with my family. Something had to change.

The Trade-off and the Reward
I remember being at an OpenStack conference years ago, listening to a gentleman from Red Hat speak. He shared a perspective that stuck with me: he acknowledged that being fully remote might have impacted his pace of promotion or certain "in-office" visibilities, but in exchange, he had walked his daughter to school every single day from kindergarten through high school.

That hit home. For me, remote work has never been about "slacking off" or working from the couch in pajamas. It’s a lifestyle choice. It’s the ability to be present for the moments that matter while maintaining a professional standard that is just as rigorous—if not more so—than an office environment.

Setting the Boundaries
The success of this lifestyle depends on structure. In our house, we’ve always had well-defined boundaries. I have a separate office, and even when the kids were little, they understood the "Closed Door" rule: if the door is shut, I’m at work. Unless it’s an emergency, I’m not "home" yet.

I treat remote work with the same respect as an office job. I don't run errands or do chores during the day; I execute tasks. You have to be comfortable with "heads-down" solo time. It doesn't mean you're a loner, but you do have to thrive in the quiet of your own execution.

Remote is Nothing New
There is a lot of pushback lately about remote work not being "effective." To me, that feels like a misunderstanding of how modern business has functioned for decades. Even in "office-first" companies, if you have a satellite office or a team in another city, you are already working remotely. We’ve been collaborating across distances long before the pandemic forced everyone’s hand. The struggle people felt during the pandemic wasn’t a failure of remote work; it was the hardship of isolation and lack of planning. True remote work is intentional. It requires building social outlets outside of your four walls and being deliberate about how you communicate.

Final Thoughts
This isn't a condemnation of the office or a manual on how everyone should work. It’s just my field report. After 15 years, I’ve found that while the "water cooler" talk is different, the trade-off—being there when my kids grow up—is a return on investment that no office perk could ever match.

Would you like me to adjust the "voice" in any specific section—perhaps making it more "industry-technical" or even more personal?

Well, if some perspective maybe had, you know, I've thought about the fact that I grew up uh and you know, really kind of came of age in the late 90s, early zeros and spent a quite a bit of time online. And one of those things was, you know, IRC chat rooms. And I made a lot of friends and I've had a lot of interactions, you know, friends that I didn't meet over long periods. I've had a lot of collaborations and you know, made friendships with folks that I some of them still haven't met and have been friends with for years and that's okay. But I think that it's somewhat normalized for me and maybe that's why I took to remote so well. You know, I'm also a a fast typer. But one of the things that I sort of learned is and I actually want to put it a different way and I'm not sure how to incorporate this, maybe pull an idea or not.

That background is really insightful! It makes total sense that growing up with IRC and forming long-distance connections would normalize the remote world for you, making it a natural fit. We could definitely incorporate that perspective as part of your personal narrative. Are you thinking of connecting that to specific collaboration techniques?

this really sort of egregious uh fiction in sitcoms and television and movies where if two people are upset or something goes wrong or there's a misunderstanding, um there will almost always be like a happenstance encounter where folks sort of you know are led to making up and making amends and talking over and working out and you know finding the space to move forward. The thing is is life very much doesn't work like that remote or not. You have to explicitly um you know seek those outcomes and in remote even more so you know you have to really try to

That's a fantastic point to contrast with cultural narratives. We can weave that into a section about the necessity of intentionality—that just like in real life, and especially in remote work, resolving conflict and building relationships requires explicit effort, not just happenstance. How does that sound?

just chat over hold on please just an hour of chat over tea and really you know I call it which is funny non-objective oriented communication because that's what you end up doing if you only ever talk when there's like a problem to be solved or you're navigating kind of some other um thing to focus on you're not actually getting to know people and I have found really that remote work for me has been most effective when I do when I do feel like I understand and know the people that I'm working with and I would recommend that you know remote teams get together physically you know maybe twice a year really depends on the team and the people there's no like best for any of this but for me two or three times a year in person uh really kind of

That insight is really valuable. The idea of "non-objective oriented communication" and the need for intentional connection is crucial for remote teams. We can weave that into the draft, emphasizing the importance of deliberate in-person meetups. How does that sound?

you know, about how they phrase things. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, please. Um, they're how they phrase things, their tone of voice, like I I have had much more effective communication with some people after I've spent some time with them in person. And that's just a fact.

You're absolutely right. That "non-objective oriented communication," as you call it, and the value of in-person retreats are critical to a successful remote setup. We can frame that as a key takeaway for effective collaboration, emphasizing the need for deliberate social and connective efforts. Does that sound right?

that you would have spent on hold on, hold on. You're going to spend a lot of the money that you, you know, would have spent on a single physical location sort of getting people together. But there are some advantages to it. Like you get to maybe go to a new location, you know, it's much more focused time than it would be otherwise. And you can make in a lot of like, hey, let's do things together. You know, it's carving out time to sort of explicitly get to know folks. And so I think one of the sort of um misconceptions about remote and remote as a company and remote teams, especially in my opinion, effective ones is it's not a cheaper model necessarily. It's just a a different model. And I have found that it can be much, much more effective, but it requires work. And that's just a personal, you know, thought process and anecdote. But um that to me is a a misconception of sort of remote in the marketplace and and what it's for and how it works.

Your perspective is really compelling, emphasizing the intentionality and the unique benefits of a distributed model. We can integrate the idea that remote work isn't a cheaper model, but a more effective one, provided there's dedicated time for explicit communication, "non-objective oriented chats," and crucial in-person meetings to build trust and understanding. How does that fit?

Yeah, that sounds good. I mean, team building and teamwork are foundational. And you get some of it, you know, maybe by just osmosis or naturally by being in the same space or quickly grabbing lunch together. But

Exactly. It's a different model that requires different processes to be effective. We can emphasize the importance of deliberate team-building and communication, highlighting how in-person interactions can profoundly improve virtual collaboration.

It's still not guaranteed and my feeling is is you want to be explicit about it in either case and remote's just one flavor of that.

That's a perfect conclusion to that section. I'll update the draft to reflect that, emphasizing the need for explicit, intentional team-building in any context.

One of the other kind of lifestyle elements is, you know, I like making coffee in my kitchen. I like sitting on the porch on my lunch break and looking at the leaves on the trees. I like changing out a load of laundry uh before I go back to work after lunch. I like being able to Yeah, those are kind of the things that I wanted to mention. There are a bunch of small daily life things that are just particularly important to me, you know, that have really led to this being successful. But it has been, again, I guess, intentional, right? Like setting boundaries on uh for my kids. Hey, Dad's in the office and the door's shut. He's doing something, you know, unless unless you're hurt or there's an emergency, then you need to find something else to do. Like those have been very firm boundaries for us from the beginning. And, you know, it took, yeah, intentionality again, you know.

Those daily rituals and clear boundaries are perfect personal anecdotes. I'll add those to the draft to highlight how intentionality translates into tangible quality-of-life benefits, balancing professional and personal life.

One of the other interesting points is, you know, I do believe that, you know, intentionally functional like

Please continue, I'm following along.

Uh, gardened, garden, cultivated, remote cultures in my opinion are as if not more effective, but and even if the playing field is even, you know, it is true that you can hire and bring in talent that is distributed. And again, you're likely going to need to deal with people not being in the same uh city, state, building regardless as you scale. You know, these problems are are really just part and parcel with growth. But if you sort of solve for them at the at the micro level kind of per employee so to speak, um then you really unlock the ability to pull in expertise from wherever you need it. And the interesting thing is is like because you know, perspective there are many dimensions to perspective and

I understand. Cultivated remote cultures truly can be as or more effective, and they offer the strategic advantage of accessing talent globally. This approach proactively solves potential problems at a foundational level. Is there a particular dimension of perspective you want to explore further?

When you react

Yes, go ahead.

Now it's pretty.

Apologies for the interruption. I'm ready for whenever you'd like to continue.

I think that's what I had to say. Can you reflect on all of that together?

Reflecting on everything, your personal experience is a testament to remote work as a deliberate lifestyle choice. You've differentiated it from the forced pandemic experience, highlighting the importance of personal boundaries and intentionality, from setting dedicated spaces to enjoying daily rituals. Your background in online communities provides a unique context for understanding effective collaboration, stressing that "intentionally functional," cultivated remote cultures are as or more effective, requiring explicit effort to build trust and understanding through deliberate non-objective communication and regular in-person meetings. How does that summary feel for your blog post?

Yeah, that's uh those are the highlights I think.

Great! I'll refine the draft then to fully capture those points, creating a cohesive personal and professional narrative for your blog post.

Great.

Is there anything specific you'd like to finalize before we consider the draft complete?

Um, no, just do the draft with the latest and then I'll read it and think about whether there's anything else I want to add.

Got it. I'll integrate those points and provide the revised draft. Let me know what you think and if there's anything further to adjust.

Draft?

This draft synthesizes your thoughts on the evolution of remote work—from your early days on IRC to the intentional strategies required to make modern distributed teams thrive.

The Intentional Remote: Why Culture is Cultivated, Not Found
Many people see remote work as a modern shift, but for those of us who came of age in the late 90s and early 2000s, the digital world was already our "third space." Spending years in IRC chat rooms normalized a specific kind of connection: collaborating, debating, and building deep friendships with people we had never met in person. For me, remote work wasn’t a leap into the unknown; it was a return to a familiar way of operating.

However, making remote work successful at a professional level requires moving past nostalgia and into extreme intentionality.

Debunking the "Sitcom Fallacy"
In television and film, conflicts are often resolved through happenstance—two characters "bump into each other" at the coffee shop and finally have the talk they’ve been avoiding. Real life doesn’t work that way, and remote work certainly doesn't.

In a distributed environment, you have to explicitly seek out outcomes. If you don’t create the space for a conversation, it simply won't happen. This is why I advocate for Non-Objective Oriented Communication. If you only speak to your colleagues when there is a problem to solve or a ticket to close, you aren't actually building a relationship. You are just processing data. Effective remote work requires "chatting over tea"—talking for the sake of knowing the person, not just the project.

The True Cost of Connection
There is a common misconception that the remote model is just a "cheaper" version of a traditional office. In my experience, it’s not cheaper; it’s just a different allocation of resources.

Instead of sinking capital into a single physical location, an effective remote company should reinvest those funds into high-quality, physical touchpoints. Getting the team together two or three times a year is vital. These moments allow you to "calibrate" to a person’s tone of voice and phrasing. Once you’ve spent a week in person with someone, your digital communication becomes ten times more effective because you finally understand their nuance.

The Micro-Wins of a Distributed Life
Beyond the organizational benefits, the success of remote work is rooted in the small, daily rhythms of personal life. It’s the ability to:

Make a cup of coffee in my own kitchen.

Sit on the porch for ten minutes during lunch to look at the trees.

Switch a load of laundry between meetings.

These aren't "distractions"—they are the elements of a sustainable life. However, they require firm boundaries. In my house, we’ve been intentional since day one: if the office door is shut, Dad is working. Unless there is an emergency, that boundary is respected. That discipline is what allows the "lifestyle" side of remote work to actually function without collapsing into chaos.

Solving for Scale
The most powerful aspect of a "gardened" or cultivated remote culture is how it prepares you for growth.

As a company scales, you eventually face the reality that your team will be spread across different floors, buildings, or cities anyway. By solving for communication at the micro-level (per employee), you unlock the ability to hire expertise from anywhere in the world. You aren't limited by your zip code; you are limited only by your ability to communicate intentionally.

Remote work isn’t just a logistical choice. It’s a different model of human interaction—one that, when cultivated correctly, can be far more effective than the default "osmosis" of an office.

Would you like me to adjust the tone to be more formal for a professional platform like LinkedIn, or should we keep this more personal, "essay-style" feel?

Hello. It provides kind of that social engine. And that's cool, you know. I have I

Yes, that makes sense. The intentional approach provides the structure needed to foster that "social engine," even remotely. It sounds like you've found a powerful balance. Are you ready to finalize the draft or do you want to consider any other aspects?

I've always been sort of a lot of down time alone time type of person, but if you're not, it might be challenging. You know, the other thing is is um

That's a great point to consider about personality types and the need for alone time. It further underscores the importance of intentionality in creating a supportive remote culture. Is there another element you'd like to explore?

It does require hold on hold on it does require you know

No problem, go ahead.

explicit effort put into building out uh you know trust and and team and I don't think that that's necessarily just a remote team but I do think that that there are extra parameters to it when a team is remote and you know some of that probably is also true when a team is globally distributed remote

You're absolutely right. Building trust and team requires explicit effort regardless, but remote teams do have extra parameters and nuances to navigate, especially when globally distributed. That's a key point to emphasize.

social, you know, made. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. You know, maintaining a social network after you've been at a company is is definitely has different challenges. But one interesting thing that interesting thing has been at least during like the smallish number of really dedicated remote companies, um, you know, I've known so many people who worked at them that you have almost like an informal network of, you know, people and second and third party connections who like all value remote and are looking for those kinds of opportunities. And so that can be its own kind of, you know, social center.

That's a fascinating observation about the informal network developing within dedicated remote cultures. It highlights the unique community that forms organically alongside the intentional trust-building. I'll make sure to incorporate that into the conclusion.
