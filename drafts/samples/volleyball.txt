My daughter of 12 has played soccer, softball, basketball, and now volleyball. 

In each new sport she tries there are teams in the respective league who have stuck together over several or even many seasons. 

These teams tend to dominate.

Her volleyball team lost with 8 girls against a team of 5 who were on the average shorter and younger. Without fail, parents on our side noted "that team has been playing together for 3 years."

This is considered a complete explanation. The subtexts are a coach who inspires loyalty, and players who choose to play together season after season. 

It strikes me that team cohesion, comraderie and continuity are an accepted winning strategy across youth sports but the same is so rarely prioritized in the adult corporate work place. 

It occurs to me that building a team of same goal oriented folks who respect one another as people is a multiyear endeavor. I think there is no substitute for vulnerability and the experience of it being valued and honored.

With fresh eyes, I am looking at tenure, explicit team building, leaders who invite commitment, players who recognize we are all coaches, and the bond that comes with knowing you can lean on the player next to you without asking.

Finding a way to stick together and getting better year after year sounds pretty good to me.
