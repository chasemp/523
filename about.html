        <div class="about-content">
              <p>I'm currently a Principal Security Engineer and Product Security Lead at Life360. I identify as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systems thinker</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassionate_leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassionate leader</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maker</a>.</p>
              
              <p>I specialize in translating "What We Are Trying To Achieve" into "How Are We Going To Achieve It" when implementing and scaling technical infrastructure, building tooling to improve developer experience, and refining real-world digital use cases with security as a first-class citizen. I work at the nexus of product, security, development, governance, and operations.</p>
              
              <p>I maintain an emphasis on business enablement, risk informed decision making, automation, and tactical optimism. I believe in fostering healthy cultures of collaboration that have helped me to build and grow successful initiatives across industries.</p>
              
              <p>I've been an individual contributor and a manager and back and back again. I have found a manager's perspective to be invaluable to being an effective senior level engineer. I have found principle level expertise to be indispensable in strengthening a team of motivated individual contributors.</p>
